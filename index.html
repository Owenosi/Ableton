      <p class="first-text">We make <a href="#">Live</a>, <a href="#">Push</a> and <a href="#">Link</a> — unique software and hardware for music
        creation and performance. With these products, our community of users
        creates amazing things.</p>
      <p class="second-text">Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in
        2001. Our products are used by a community of dedicated musicians, sound
        designers, and artists from across the world.</p>

    <p class="third-text">Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning.
      But when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.</p>

    <p class="fourth-text">We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force
      behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make it
      for.</p>

    <span>Why Ableton - Juanpe Bolivar</span>

    <p class="fifth-text">We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided
      between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and
      Tokyo.</p>

    <p class="fourth-text">Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use
      Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
      professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
      and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared
      belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to
      something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>

      <img class="image5" src="images/ableton2-2.png" alt="">
      <img class="image6" src="images/ableton2-3.png" alt="">

      <p class="sixth-text">We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments.
        We only work on a few products and we strive to make them great.</p>

      <p class="seventh-text">Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
        people what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned that
        achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly
        diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of
        perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion
        and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <div class="image7">
    <img class="" src="images/ableton2-4.png" alt="" />
    <p class="first-text">We’re passionate about what we do, but we’re equally passionate about
      improving who we are.</p>
    <p class="second-text">We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both personally
      and professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to
      learn from and with each other.

      Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in
      acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily
      work. In addition, staff-organized development and music salons are a chance to
      discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</p>

      looking for exceptional talent from around the world, we will do everything
      we can to make your transition as easy as possible.</p>
    <p class="ninth-text">If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with
      relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free German or English
      lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health
      insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and
      paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have
      several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of
      fun, informal small-group activities. </p>
